                    <div class="text">It is the first major redesign since the iPhone X, similar to that of iPad Pros
                        since 2018 and the 4th-generation iPad Air. The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini have a new design
                        featuring a flat chassis, a design seen with the iPhone 4 until the iPhone 5S and the original
                        iPhone SE. The notch size is similar to previous iPhone models, despite speculation about a
                        reduction in width.[16] The borders around the display are thinner by 35% than any previous
                        model. The new design also comes with a ceramic-hardened front glass, marketed as Ceramic
                        Shield, while the back retains the previous generation Dual-Ion Exchange strengthened glass.

                        Product (Red). There is a notch at the front for the TrueDepth camera system and speaker,
                        similar to its predecessor, the iPhone XR. There is a bump in the back for the cameras and the
                        flash that is the same size as the iPhone 11 Pro, although the iPhone 11 only has two cameras
                        compared to the Pro's three cameras.[7][4] Also, the iPhone 11 has a matte glass rear camera
                        housing and glossy glass back, while the iPhone 11 Pro has a glossy glass rear camera housing
                        and matte glass back. The Apple logo is now centered on the back of the device with no text, a
                        change from previous models.

                    <div class="text">The iPhone 7's overall design is similar to iPhone 6S and iPhone 6. Changes
                        introduced included new color options (matte black and jet black), water and dust resistance, a
                        new capacitive, static home button, revised antenna bands, and the removal of the 3.5 mm
                        headphone jack. The device's internal hardware received upgrades, including a heterogeneous
                        quad-core system-on-chip with improved system and graphics performance, upgraded 12 megapixel
                        rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models, and an additional telephoto
                        lens exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus to provide enhanced (2x) optical zoom capabilities and
                        portrait mode.</div>
